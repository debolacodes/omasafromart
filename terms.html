                        At Oma's AfroMart, we accept returns and exchanges within 7 days of delivery for items that are unused, unopened, and in their original packaging. Perishable items are non-returnable due to food safety regulations. This is because once a perishable food item has been sold to a consumer, it's impossible to guarantee that it has been stored and handled properly to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Returning such items and then reselling them could pose a health risk to other consumers. To request a return, contact us with your order number, reason, and a photo of the item. Approved refunds will be processed to your original payment method within 5–7 business days. Shipping fees are non-refundable unless the error was on our end.
